pragma solidity 0.4.8;

// These abstract contracts are only provided to make the
// interface known to the compiler. Note the function
// without body. If a contract does not implement all
// functions it can only be used as an interface.

// Let me write an abstract contract with a single function and then extend it 
// in the new contract and then override it there.
contract Feline {
	// This is how we write the abstract contract 
    function utterance() returns (bytes32);
}

// inherit the contract in cat and then override the function utterance with some full definition
contract Cat is Feline {
    function utterance() returns (bytes32) { return "miaow"; }
}
